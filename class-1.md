# Creative Coding
#### What is Creative coding?
* Discuss this question
* Who has experience, and with what area?
* History
	* [Demoscene](http://www.pouet.net/)

#### Why
* It's art
* It's fun
* It's geeky
* It's a valuable/emerging skill
	* Huge crossover/niche potential
	* It's important to have a unique skillset
* It's mostly graphical, but hardware, physical & other applications are getting easier.

#### Job opportunities
* Artist
* The sciences (G.V.)
* Designer
* Architect
* Data visualization
* Web development
* Mobile app development
* Video games
* General UI development
* ["Join the Creative Class"](http://www.forbes.com/sites/elainepofeldt/2012/12/28/want-to-recession-proof-yourself-join-the-creative-class/)

#### Background
* Multi-media:
	* Video :: [1](https://vimeo.com/10902493) [2](https://vimeo.com/9795430)
	* Audio :: [1](https://vimeo.com/23281150) [2](https://vimeo.com/38429577)
	* Imagery :: 
	* (Realtime) Data :: 
	* Sculpture :: [1](http://mariuswatz.com/2012/05/09/probability-lattice/)
	* Architecture :: [1](http://mariuswatz.com/2012/02/07/arcs-rockheim/)
	* Dance [1](https://vimeo.com/38840688)
	* Jewelry / Products [1](https://vimeo.com/41450718) [2](http://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/shop/product.php?code=129&tag=jewelry)
	* Video games [1](https://vimeo.com/43230920)
* Build fun
* Integrate disparate technologies
* Art
	* A medium that makes money? 
* Computational design
* Data Visualization
* Advertising / PR

#### Techniques / Building Blocks
###### Live coding walkthrough with Processing.js 
[Explain similarity between Processing, \<canvas\>, iOS]


* Shapes
* Color
* Motion
* Repetition (for())
* Iteration
* Randomness
* OOP
* Better motion
* Oscillation
* Basic trigonometry (movement & orientation)
* 3D / lighting
* Nature / fractals / Recursion
* Sound
* Hardware inputs
	* Mouse
	* Webcam
	* Accelerometer (iOS, Wii, Playstation)
	* Depth camera (Kinect, Xtion)
* Data:
	* Image
	* Audio
	* Data sets
* Environment
* Haxademic library - more advanced examples
* Imagine the process to acheive more complex projects that we've seen
	
###### How to learn & improve
* Enjoy it
* Give yourself assignments
* Play with new techniques
* Read other developers' code
	
###### Physical computing
* New computing paradigms
* Apple touch/gestures
* Leap Motion 
* Minority Report [1](http://kolidar.com/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Minority-report_2.jpg)
* Environments / realtime interaction (projection mappings)



* Practice to build skills to make money with fun. 
* examples via video, etc, arduino & other tech mentions

* tie into PR & advertising for promo & money for your art
* art for art's sake - artist statements, experiential (VJ application)
Nature / fractals
Image processing, frame-by-frame
image & audio and just data to play with
building blocks / bag of tricks to achieve what you're going for
^^ go over these tricks for your bag and why they're important - how can we combine these tricks?
^^ even more advanced tricks that I don't understand



Kinect
What is the Kinect?
Why is it important? (bringing to the masses, accessible, MS developer embrace)
More technical : 2D array of datas: RGB, Depth, machine learning for MS brains behind it
Open source - OPENNI, 

### Demos
* Kinect user location to Audio location
* Kinect "wind" experiment - blob tracking accelerates an overall wind force
* Kinect - particles on blob, flying in direction of blob movement? Or just up
* Kinect particles flying between skeleton parts [x]
* A/V installation with live audio processing the environment and kinetic visuals



### Assignment #1
students should research the tools, find examples of what they like
